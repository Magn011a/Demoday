                <p>As we say goodbye to the poor air quality of winter, we need to prepare for air pollution in spring. 
                    Areas with serious air pollution problems are usually easy to spot. Thick smog from the air pollution 
                    blankets the skyline in a haze of smoke and the smell in the air is enough to make you feel light-headed
                     or sick. But, in many places, air pollution is less extreme. You may not see the pollutants in the sky 
                     nor know that they are even there except for suffering from an unexplainable cough or irritated throat.
                      Other symptoms of air pollution’s effects include dry eyes, nose and skin; coughing, sneezing and 
                      wheezing; and tiredness and dizziness.</p>

                <p>Polluted air also works as a habitat for infectious viruses that pass to your lungs and other parts of 
                    your body as you breathe. According to the World Health Organization, about 7 million people die due to 
                    outdoor and indoor air pollution each year. Microscopic air pollutants slip past our body’s defenses, 
                    penetrate our respiratory and circulatory systems, and damage our lungs, heart and brain.</p>

                <p>Currently, there is 5.25 trillion pieces of trash in the ocean.  It is estimated that 100 million animals die each year due to water pollution.
